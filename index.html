          <h2>About the paper</h2>
          <p>
            This paper is the first step in my research into electoral and
            apportionment systems. I wrote my work under the supervision of Pál
            Burai, PhD, associate professor of the <a href="https://math.bme.hu/?language=en" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer">
              Institute of Mathematics at the
              Budapest University of Technology and Economics Faculty of Natural
              Sciences
            </a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I start my paper with a brief summary of the history of the Electoral
            College. I then describe how the American apportionment system works.
            It uses a method designed by American mathematician Edward V.
            Huntington in the early 20th century, and is still in use today. It
            uses the <strong>method of the geometric mean</strong>. I also analyzed how we can
            modify this method for different mathematical means and what kind of
            effect this would have on the apportionment.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also wrote briefly about how elections for the European Parliament
            work. <strong>
              I adapted Huntington's method and its modified versions to the
              European elections
            </strong> and analyzed how it would impact the composition of
            the European Parliament, and which countries would be the biggest
            winners and losers of such a system.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the final section, I created fictional scenarios for elections
            (such as including Puerto Rico in US elections, and including Ukraine
            in European elections). To make the simulations easier, I wrote a
            Python program that would perform all of the required calculations. I
            included the code in my paper along with a line-by-line explanation of
            the code.
          </p>
          <h3>Abstract</h3>
          <p>
            The goal of this work is the analysis of the American apportionment
            system. The distribution of the number of electoral seats generated by
            different methods involving geometric, arithmetic and harmonic means
            are compared, and these methods to the European Parliament adapted.
            The data is generated by a Python program. For the examination of the
            distribution of the number of seats generated by different methods
            both real and artificial data are used.

            My first presentation was at the students' scientific conference of
            the Budapest Technology and Economics Faculty of Natural Sciences.
            There, I competed against fellow high school students who presented
            their findings in a wide range of topics in the fields of mathematics
            and physics.
          </p>
          <p>
            The conference was held on November 17, 2022 in Building H of the
            Budapest University of Technology and Economics.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the conference, I received positive reviews of my paper and my
            presentation. <strong>
              The jury awarded me second place and offered me the
              opportionity to present my findings at the national conference.

          <p>
            The second presentation was held at the University of Pannonia in
            Veszprém, Hungary. This university was the host of the 36th National
            Conference of Students' Research Societies in the Physics, Earth
            Sciences and Mathematics section. I was assigned to the Operations
            research subsection. I was the only high school student competing in
            the section, where the other contestants were mainly graduate
            students. The jury gave me encouraging comments about continuing my
            research.

          <img class="float-end ms-3 portrait" src="img/portrait.jpeg" alt="A portrait of the author" />
          <p>
            My name is Zsolt Szabó. I am currently a first-year Computer Science
            student at the <a href="https://www.inf.elte.hu/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Faculty of
              Informatics of Eötvös Lóránd University</a>,
            Budapest.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started my research project as a high school student. I went to
            <a href="https://arpadgimi.hu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Árpád High School</a> in my
            hometown of Tatabánya where I studied from
            2017 to 2023. I completed my high school leaving exam there as well,
            where I received an award for achieving the highest scores of the
            school.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my high school years, I participated in many competitions in my
            fields of interest. I competed on the national level a few times, most
            notably achieving <strong>
              15th place at the National Competition for High
              School Students in Computer Science
            </strong>, which is the most prestigious
            high school competition in Hungary.
          </p>
          <p>
            My main academic interests are Computer Science and Mathematics, but I
            am interested in many other topics such as politics, modern history
            and international relations as well, which is one of the reasons why I
            chose this research topic. I am glad that I have the opportunity to
            research a subject where I can use both my mathematical and my
            political interests.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2023, I was awarded the title of <strong>
              the most successful high school
              student
            </strong> by the Mayor of Tatabánya.

          <p>
            This website is about the paper that I originally presented at the
            National Conference of Students' Research Societies, however I wish to
            continue my research beyond my findings in this paper. Currently, I
            have two main directions that I would like to continue my research in.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first is a deeper analysis of why some methods benefit smaller
            states while others benefit larger states. I wish to find an exact
            mathematical formula that we can use to exactly define what a 'small'
            and a 'large' state is.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second is looking at how we can include more factors in
            apportionment. In the apportionment methods that I discussed in my
            paper, the sole factor that determines how many representatives a
            state has is its population. Using the <strong>Bajraktarevic mean</strong>, I would
            like to explore how we can add further factors (such as
            <abbr title="Gross Domestic Product">GDP</abbr>,
            <abbr title="Human Development Index">HDI</abbr>) that determine the
            number of representatives a state has.
          </p>
          <aside>
            I believe that this topic is
            especially relevent in Europe, where the enlargement of the Union
            poses new political questions regarding apportionment, and the
            inclusion of other factors when assigning the seats to each country
            may help solve these issues.
