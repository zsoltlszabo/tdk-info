<p>After the foundation of the United States in 1776, the Founding
Fathers needed to establish a method for choosing the officeholders in
the different branches of government.</p>
<p>The keyword when looking at the history American electoral system is
“compromise”. The founders needed to resolve the conflict between the
smaller and larger states. The small states wanted each state to be
equally represented in the decision-making, while the large states
wanted representation to be proportional to the population. The result
of this compromise was a bicameral legislature. In the Senate, every
state has two senators, thus giving the smaller states a lot of power in
the legislative process. In the House of Representatives, each state has
a certain number of representatives proportional to its population, with
each state having at least one seat in the House. The US constitution
requires that the seats assigned to each state be proportional to its
population, but it doesn’t specify any method to use for
apportionment.</p>
<p>The method for electing the executive is derived from the method for
electing the legislature. The President is not directly elected by the
people, rather by the Electoral College. According to this system, each
state is assigned a certain number of electors, who will vote according
to the will of the voters. Each state is assigned the same number of
electors as seats in the Congress (representatives + senators). Most
states award all of their electors to the candidate who received the
most votes in their state. To win the election, a candidate needs the
votes of a majority of all electors.</p>

<p>The apportionment system of the United States utilizes the Huntington
method which is described in detail <a

<h3 id="the-history-1">The history</h3>
<p>The President of the European Commission is the most powerful
official in the European Union. This position is comparable to prime
ministers in parliamentary democracies or presidents in presidential
republics.</p>
<p>The election of the President is a contentious issue after every
European election. To resolve this issue, the Spitzenkandidaten system
was developed. According to this system, the person nominated by the
party with the most seats in the European Parliament will become the
President of the European Commission. This system was last used in 2014,
when Jean-Claude Juncker of the European People’s Party was elected
President, after the centre-right party won a plurality of seats in the
European Parliament.</p>
<p>The equivalent document of the US Constitution for the European Union
which establishes the branches of government is the Treaty of Lisbon. It
establishes the European Parliament as the primary legislative
institution of the EU. Like the US Constitution, the Treaty does not
specify the apportionment method, but it does set some guidelines. The
document establishes the 705-seats of the European Parliament. It gives
every member state at least six, and at most 96 seats in the
Parliament.</p>
<p>The Treaty also requires any apportionment method to adhere to the
principle of degressive proportionality. The guidelines for the current
method of apportionment were described in the Cambridge compromise,
which was finalised at the Cambridge Apportionment Meeting (CAM). (see ,
)</p>

<p>Degressive proportionality means “the ratio between the population
and the number of seats of each Member State must vary in relation to
their respective populations in such a way that each Member from a more
populous Member State represents more citizens than each Member from a
less populous Member State and conversely, but also that no less
populous Member State has more seats than a more populous Member State.”
(this is known as the Lamassoure-Severin definition, see )</p>
<p>The following requirements were devised at the Cambridge
Apportionment Meeting:</p>
<ul>
<li>“no smaller State shall receive more seats than a larger
State,”</li>
<li>“the ratio population/seats shall increase as population
increases.”</li>
</ul>
<p>At the time, it seemed impossible to design a system that satisfies
both requirements under the hypotheticals tested. This resulted in the
modification of the Lamassoure-Severin definition. After the amendment,
it defined degressive proportionality as follows: “the ratio between the
population and the number of seats of each Member State before rounding
to whole numbers must vary in relation to their respective populations
in such a way that each Member from a more populous Member State
represents more citizens than each Member from a less populous Member
State and conversely, but also that no less populous Member State has
more seats than a more populous Member State.”</p>
<p>After the definition was amended, the Cambridge Apportionment Meeting
developed the base + prop method for apportionment.</p>
<h4 id="base-prop-method">Base + prop method</h4>
<p>The base + prop method for apportionment consists of two stages, as
written in :</p>
<ul>
<li>The allocation of a fixed (base) number of states to each member
state.</li>
<li>The allocation of the remaining states in proportion to the member
state’s population (subject to rounding and capping at the
maximum).</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve the desired size for the Parliament, a house-size divisor
is introduced. Using the given base <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em></span>, maximum <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> and divisor <span
class="math inline"><em>d</em></span>, we can define the following
allocation function <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub><em>d</em></sub> : [0, ∞) → [0, ∞)</span>:
<span class="math display">$$
A_d (p) = \min \left\{ b + \frac{p}{d}, M \right\}
$$</span> We shall assign the seat share <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub><em>d</em></sub>(<em>p</em>)</span>
to the member state with population <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em></span>. After that, we need to round this
to an integer, and adjust the divisor <span
class="math inline"><em>d</em></span>, so that the sum of the seat
numbers equals the desired Parliament size.</p>
<p>The Cambridge Apportionment Meeting recommended the use of base <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em> = 5</span>, and the use of upwards
rounding.</p>
