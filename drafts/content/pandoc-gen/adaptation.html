<h1 id="adaptation-of-the-huntington-method-for-the-eu">Adaptation of
the Huntington method for the EU</h1>
<p>There are two approaches we can take when adapting Huntington’s
method.</p>
<p>The first is to completely ignore the principle of degressive
proportionality and give every state near equal representation in the
European Parliament. Taking this approach would lead us to a Parliament
which looks more like the US House of Representatives.</p>
<p>The second approach is to keep the principle of degressive
proportionality but grant every member state an m minimum number of
seats, and allocate the remaining seats using Huntington’s method
subject to a maximum of 96 seats. After a member state reaches 96 seats,
it shall be assigned no more seats. These guidelines were established
[Gri12, Page 3].</p>
<h2 id="ignoring-degressive-proportionality">Ignoring degressive
proportionality</h2>
<p>If we wish to ignore the principle of degressive proportionality, we
will get a result, where every member state has roughly equal
representation. This will give us a result that gives the more populous
member states (such as Germany and France) a lot more power when
compared to the current system. The results, if we applied the different
methods using the Python program, can be found in the following table:

When comparing the apportionment data between the three methods, we can
only see a difference in the case of two states. The method of the
arithmetic mean assigns one seat fewer to Cyprus, and one more to
Germany than the other two methods. Cyprus is one of the least populous
states in the European Union, and Germany is the most populous. This
also highlights that the method of the arithmetic mean favours larger
states over smaller states. As we no longer use the principle of
degressive proportionality, we can see the effects of the removal of the
cap on the number of representatives. Germany and France have crossed
the 96 seat-threshold currently used during apportionment, with Italy
coming close at 95 seats. The minimum number of seats assigned to a
state has also been lowered to one. This also causes significant
differences and gives less power to the smaller states. From these
results, it is clear why the principle of degressive proportionality is
crucial in the balance between the power of a member state, and the
power of the people living in the European Union. Using this system, the
four most populous states alone would have a sizeable 402-seat (or
403-seat) majority.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-degressive-proportionality">Keeping degressive
proportionality</h2>
<p>We will use a version of the Python code modified according to the
guidelines in [Gri12, Page 3]. The code along with a full, line-by-line
explanation can be found in section 4.2. Using census data from 2011
from across the European Union, we have arrived at the following
composition using the different methods (see the table below). Using
this data, we can see that all three methods generated the same results.
When analysing the difference between our apportionment and the official
apportionment, we can notice a few major differences. As this simulation
respects degressive proportionality, we can say that the least populous
member states benefited greatly from this apportionment. We also see
that there are more states with the minimum number of seats than under
the current system. The only member state that reached the maximum of 96
seats under the current system is Germany. Germany reached this
threshold under our system as well, making Germany less represented than
the smaller states. We can also see that a larger number of states
reached 96 seats. These states were already populous, so we can say that
this system benefits the larger states as well. Another significant
statement that we can make after looking the data is that the
medium-sized states were the biggest losers of our system. They lost
seats at the expense of larger states. <img src="tables/w_deg_prop.png"
