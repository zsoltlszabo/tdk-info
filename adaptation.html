            Adaptation of the Huntington method for the European Union

                <section class="block1" id="eu_non_deg">
                    <p>There are <strong>two approaches</strong> we can take when adapting Huntington's method. </p>
                    <p>The first is to completely <strong>
                            ignore the principle of degressive proportionality and give every
                            state
                            near
                            equal representation in the European Parliament
                        </strong>. Taking this approach would lead us to a
                        Parliament
                        which looks more like the US House of Representatives. </p>
                    <p>The second approach is to <strong>
                            keep the principle of degressive proportionality but grant every member
                            state
                            an m minimum number of seats, and allocate the remaining seats using Huntington's method
                            subject
                            to
                            a
                            maximum of 96 seats
                        </strong>. After a member state reaches 96 seats, it shall be assigned no more seats.
                        These
                        guidelines were established [<a href="#Gri12">Gri12</a>, Page 3]. </p>
                    <h2>Ignoring degressive proportionality</h2>
                    <p><strong>If we wish to ignore the principle of degressive proportionality</strong>, we will get a result, where
                        every
                        member state has roughly equal representation. This <strong>
                            will give us a result that gives the more
                            populous
                            member states
                        </strong> (such as Germany and France) <strong>have a lot more power when compared to the current system</strong>.
                        The
                        results, if we applied the different methods using the Python program, can be found in the
                        following
                        table: </p>
                    TABLE
                    <p>When comparing the apportionment data between the three methods, we can only see a difference in
                        the
                        case
                        of two states. The method of the arithmetic mean assigns one seat fewer to Cyprus, and one more
                        to
                        Germany than the other two methods. Cyprus is one of the least populous states in the European
                        Union,
                        and Germany is the most populous. This also highlights that <strong>
                            the method of the arithmetic mean
                            favours
                            larger states over smaller states
                        </strong>. </p>
                    <p>As we no longer use the principle of degressive proportionality, we can see the effects of the
                        removal of
                        the cap on the number of representatives. Germany and France have crossed the 96 seat-threshold
                        currently used during apportionment, with Italy coming close at 95 seats. </p>
                    <p>The minimum number of seats assigned to a state has also been lowered to one. This also causes
                        significant differences and gives less power to the smaller states. </p>
                    <p>From these results, it is clear why <strong>
                            the principle of degressive proportionality is crucial in the
                            balance
                            between the power of a member state, and the power of the people living in the European
                            Union
                        </strong>.
                        Using
                        this system, the four most populous states alone would have a sizeable 402-seat (or 403-seat)
                        majority.

                    <h2>Keeping degressive proportionality</h2>
                    <p>We will use a version of the Python code modified according to the guidelines in [<a
                            href="#Gri12">Gri12</a>, Page 3]. The
                        code along with a full, line-by-line explanation can be found in section 4.2 of the paper. Using
                        census data
                        from
                        2011 from across the European Union, we have arrived at the following composition using the
                        different
                        methods (see the table below). </p>
                    <p>Using this data, we can see that <strong>all three methods generated the same results</strong>. When analysing the
                        difference between our apportionment and the official apportionment, we can notice a few major
                        differences. </p>
                    <p><strong>
                        As this simulation respects degressive proportionality, we can say that the least populous member
                            states
                            benefited greatly from this apportionment.
                    </strong> We also see that there are more states with the
                        minimum
                        number of seats than under the current system. </p>
                    <p>The only member state that reached the maximum of 96 seats under the current system is Germany.
                        Germany
                        reached this threshold under our system as well, making Germany less represented than the
                        smaller
                        states. </p>
                    <p>We can also see that a larger number of states reached 96 seats. These states were already
                        populous,
                        so
                        we can say that this system benefits the larger states as well. </p>
                    <p>Another significant statement that we can make after looking the data is that <strong>
                        the medium-sized
                            states
                            were the biggest losers of our system
                    </strong>. They lost seats at the expense of larger states. </p>
