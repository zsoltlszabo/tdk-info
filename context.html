                    <h2>United States</h2>
                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>After the foundation of the United States in 1776, the Founding Fathers needed to establish a
                        method
                        for
                        choosing the officeholders in the different branches of government. </p>
                    <p><strong>The keyword when looking at the history American electoral system is "compromise".
                        </strong>The founders
                        needed to
                        resolve the conflict between the smaller and larger states. The small states wanted each state
                        to be
                        equally
                        represented in the decision-making, while the large states wanted representation to be
                        proportional
                        to the
                        population. <strong>The result of this compromise was a bicameral legislature.</strong> In the
                        Senate, every
                        state
                        has two
                        senators, thus giving the smaller states a lot of power in the legislative process. In the House
                        of
                        Representatives, each state has a certain number of representatives proportional to its
                        population,
                        with
                        each state having at least one seat in the House. <strong>
                            The US constitution requires that the seats
                            assigned to
                            each state be proportional to its population, but it doesn't specify any method to use for
                            apportionment.
                        </strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>The method for electing the executive is derived from the method for electing the legislature.
                        <strong>
                            The
                            President
                            is not directly elected by the people, rather by the Electoral College.
                        </strong> According to this
                        system,
                        each state
                        is assigned a certain number of electors, who will vote according to the will of the voters.
                        <strong>
                            Each
                            state is
                            assigned the same number of electors as seats in the Congress
                        </strong> (representatives + senators). Most
                        states
                        award all of their electors to the candidate who received the most votes in their state. To win
                        the
                        election, <strong>a candidate needs the votes of a majority of all electors</strong>.

                    <h2>European Union</h2>
                    <h3>The history</h3>
                    <p><strong>The President of the European Commission is the most powerful official in the European
                            Union.</strong>
                        This
                        position
                        is comparable to prime ministers in parliamentary democracies or presidents in presidential
                        republics.</p>
                    <p>The election of the President is a contentious issue after every European election. To resolve
                        this
                        issue,
                        the Spitzenkandidaten system was developed. According to this system, the person nominated by
                        the
                        party with
                        the most seats in the European Parliament will become the President of the European Commission.
                        This
                        system
                        was last used in 2014, when Jean-Claude Juncker of the European People's Party was elected
                        President, after
                        the centre-right party won a plurality of seats in the European Parliament.</p>
                    <p>The equivalent document of the US Constitution for the European Union which establishes the
                        branches
                        of
                        government is <strong>the Treaty of Lisbon</strong>. It <strong>establishes the European
                            Parliament</strong> as the primary
                        legislative
                        institution of the EU. Like the US Constitution, <strong>
                            the Treaty does not specify the apportionment
                            method, but
                            it does set some guidelines
                        </strong>. The document establishes the 705-seats of the European Parliament.
                        It
                        gives
                        every member state at least six, and at most 96 seats in the Parliament.</p>
                    <p><strong>
                            The Treaty also requires any apportionment method to adhere to the principle of degressive
                            proportionality.
                        </strong>
                        The guidelines for the current method of apportionment were <strong>
                            described in the Cambridge
                            compromise
                        </strong>,
                        which was
                        finalised at the Cambridge Apportionment Meeting (CAM). (see [<a href="#Gri12">Gri12</a>, Page

                        </strong>
                        (this is known as the Lamassoure-Severin definition, see [<a href="#Gri12">Gri12</a>, Page 2])
                    </p>
                    <p>The following requirements were devised at the Cambridge Apportionment Meeting:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <blockquote>"no smaller State shall receive more seats than a larger State,"</blockquote>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <blockquote>"the ratio population/seats shall increase as population increases."
                            </blockquote>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>At the time, <strong>it seemed impossible to design a system that satisfies both
                            requirements</strong> under the
                        hypotheticals
                        tested. <strong>This resulted in the modification of the Lamassoure-Severin definition.</strong>
                        After the
                        amendment,
                        it
                        defined degressive proportionality as follows:</p>
                    <blockquote>"the ratio between the population and the number of seats of each Member State before
                        rounding to
                        whole numbers must vary in relation to their respective populations in such a way that each
                        Member
                        from a
                        more populous Member State represents more citizens than each Member from a less populous Member
                        State and
                        conversely, but also that no less populous Member State has more seats than a more populous
                        Member
                        State."
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>After the definition was amended, the Cambridge Apportionment Meeting developed the <em>base +

                    <p>To achieve the desired size for the Parliament, a house-size divisor is introduced. Using the
                        given
                        base $b$,
                        maximum $M$ and divisor $d$, we can define the following allocation function $A_d: [0, \infty)
                        \to
                        [0,
                        \infty)$:</p>
                    $$
                    A_d (p) = \min \left\{ b + \frac{p}{d}, M \right \}
                    $$
                    <p>We shall assign the seat share $A_d (p)$ to the member state with population $p$. After that, we
                        need
                        to
                        round this to an integer, and adjust the divisor $d$, so that the sum of the seat numbers equals
                        the
                        desired
                        Parliament size. </p>

                            The Cambridge Apportionment Meeting recommended the use of base $b = 5$, and the use of
                            upwards
                            rounding.
