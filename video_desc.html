                Description of the video
            </h2>
            <p>The video starts with a montage of major elections. It also shows speeches made by former presidents. It
                then
                shows a montage of people voting. During the montage, the narrator describes how the people are not
                actually
                voting for the President. After the montage, Professor William Ewald, Professor of Law and Philosophy of
                the
                University of Pennsylvania tells the viewers that the representation in the electoral college is equal
                to
                congressional representation. He also thinks that the designers of the system did not believe that it
                was
                the best system. The video now shows a graph indicating that the people are not voting for actual
                representatives, instead they are voting for a slate of electors. The video shows images of the American
                revolution, and images of the different branches of government. Professor Ewald tells the viewers that
                the
                system was very informal at the beginning. He also describes problems in American society at the time,
                which
                are illustrated by clips in the video. Professor Ewald then introduces the idea of a new constitution,
                but
                also describes the issues regarding the idea. The greatest issue concerned the leader of the country and
                their election. Different ideas were introduced like a committee elected by congress. The video shows
                some
                images illustrating this idea. Professor Ewald then tells the story of James Wilson, who introduced the
                idea
                of having one person in charge of the government. He wanted the people to directly elect this person.
                The
                video then shows images of the infrastructure of the age. The professor then tells the viewers about the
                concerns some people had regarding this system. Wilson then proposed an indirect election. The video now
                shows the constitution, and some illustrations about the negotiations. The viewers are then introduced
                to
                the chaos the elections brought. The video then shows some images that highlight the chaos (like people
                fighting). Political parties are then introduced to elections. The final solution to these issues was
                the
                winner take all system that sought to maximize the influence of individual states. The video ends with
                the
                credits and showing the National Geographic logo.</p>

            every four years it happens again
            all trying to convince you that one
            candidate above all the rest
            i have the experience has got the right
            mix of stuff
            join me to lead america this is crazy
            but no matter what name you're bubbling
            in
            you're not actually voting for that
            person
            and that's because of this thing in the
            u.s called the electoral college
            and like many things in politics you
            either love it
            or you really hate it
            the electoral college is the device
            where each of the states
            selects a certain number of electors
            equal to their representation in
            congress
            if you ask the people involved did you
            do a brilliant job in 1787
            the designers themselves would say no it
            didn't work it had to be
            fixed we'll get back to that point in a
            minute
            but here's how it works today citizens
            of the state
            they cast their votes for candidate a
            candidate b
            candidate c they're not actually voting
            directly for
            the candidates they're voting for a
            slate of electors who gather together
            and cast their state's votes right but
            why do we have it at all
            well if we go back over 200 years
            america had 13 states
            and less than 4 million people it was
            way different
            during the revolutionary war you had a
            somewhat
            informal government there was no supreme
            court
            the presidency there was none the
            congress didn't know uncertain terms it
            was dysfunctional
            the articles of confederation were not
            functioning particularly well
            worse there was economic problems
            possible unrest barely a decade old
            america was pretty much a hot mess they
            decided
            we need to write a brand new
            constitution from scratch
            but there were a ton of issues and no
            one could agree what a new government
            should even look like the election of
            the president that was
            probably the single most difficult issue
            whether you should have
            a committee maybe three or four people
            serving as the
            chiefs of the executive branch or how
            they'd be chosen
            one plan was to let congress elect the
            executive branch
            some liked it others didn't and one
            person who didn't james wilson
            he had an unusual idea of his own a
            government
            led by a single person the convention
            type goes silent
            and everybody is looking very worried at
            one another
            as they say we just had a revolution to
            get rid of the king
            isn't that just going to be a monarch
            under a new name
            wilson followed that up with an equally
            unpopular idea
            let the people choose the president by
            popular vote
            there were numerous objections and
            because national campaigning wasn't
            really a thing yet
            no one was convinced the public would
            even know who to vote for
            in the 18th century you had primitive
            roads
            transportation was by horseback
            newspapers were
            primitive so the question would be how
            could somebody in massachusetts
            judge a presidential candidate from
            north carolina
            and even if they were informed direct
            popular election that will just mean the
            big states are going to elect the
            president
            others said let the state legislatures
            pick the president
            wilson wanted at all costs to keep that
            selection
            out of the hands of congress out of the
            hands of the states
            came and said okay if you don't like
            direct popular election
            why don't we do indirect election and
            like that
            wilson's plan it gained some light
            [Music]
            so after months of arguing they had a
            plan for a brand new government
            and the electoral college the
            constitution was signed
            and everyone went home happy right yeah
            uh wrong
            there's plenty of private correspondence
            where figures like
            james madison alexander hamilton are
            saying
            this whole document is a compromise we
            don't really like it
            it's probably not gonna last more than
            five or ten years we'll be back at the
            drawing board
            pretty soon and they were right the
            first two elections went
            okay but some of the early ones were
            absolute
            chaos
            the electoral college it was designed to
            balance the powers of the government
            and protect the rights of the people but
            there were a lot of holes in it they
            expected the electors
            to come together and to deliberate among
            themselves
            they were supposed to be exercising
            independent political judgment
            when you got the growth of political
            parties very quickly people began to
            pledge saying if you vote for me
            i will vote for the federalist or i will
            vote for the jeffersonian
            republican at that point they had to go
            back to the drawing board
            and so that electoral college it's been
            changed tweaked
            amended and now most states they have
            the winner take all system
            early on they figured out a winner take
            all system
            is the one you want to adopt if you're
            going to maximize your state's
            influence if you split your votes then
            people aren't going to pay as much
            attention to you as if you say
            look here here's this great big pile of
            electoral votes
            they're all going to go to one candidate
            for another
            [Music]
            our founders couldn't see the future and
            today
            the electoral college yeah it's still
            controversial
            but there are lessons to be learned from
            its creation history
            tends to outrun the plans of even the
            founding
            generation what would they think if they
            came back and they looked
            system today it's anybody's guess the
            only one that i can say with any
            confidence
            that would be james wilson he would say
            for heaven's sake
            you need a system of direct popular
            election in this country
            i was right the other delegates were wrong
