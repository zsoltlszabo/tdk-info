<h1 id="the-huntington-method">The Huntington method</h1>
<p>The current method of apportionment was developed by an American
mathematician, Edward V. Huntington in the early 20th century. The
method was described in , , and .</p>
<h2 id="the-requirements-for-the-system">The requirements for the
system</h2>
<p>Huntington determined, that given two states, which have populations
<span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> respectively, have <span
class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em></span> seats in the House, the perfect
system would give a result where</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$
\frac{A}{a} = \frac{B}{b} \text{.}
$$</span></p>
<p>As it would be basically impossible to satisfy this equation in a
representative democracy, Huntington’s goal was to make this inequality
as small as possible.</p>
<h2 id="the-absolute-difference-and-the-relative-difference">The
absolute difference and the relative difference</h2>
<p>A crucial question in developing the system was whether to use the
absolute or the relative difference for the apportionment process. For
example, if there are two districts, one with a population of 1,000 and
another one with 1,001 people, the absolute difference here is 1, and
the relative difference is 0.1%, but if two districts have a population
of 10 and 11, the absolute difference would still be 1, but the relative
difference would be 10%. Due to this reason, Huntington recommended the
use of the relative difference instead of the absolute one. We can
achieve the relative difference between states <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> by calculating <span
class="math inline">$\frac{\frac{A}{a}-\frac{B}{b}}{\frac{B}{b}}$</span>.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-test-for-the-method-of-equal-proportions">The first
test for the method of equal proportions</h2>
<p>Huntington defined the first test for his method (known as the method
of equal proportions or the method of the geometric mean, which we will
be abbreviating as MGM) as follows (see ) :</p>
<p>“If the relative difference between the congressional districts,
<span class="math inline">$\frac{A}{a}$</span> and <span
class="math inline">$\frac{B}{b}$</span>, belonging to any two states
can be reduced by a transfer of a representative from one state to the
other, then this transfer should be made.”</p>
<p>We can write the following “inequality” for the test: <span
class="math display">$$
\frac{\frac{A}{a + 1} - \frac{B}{b}}{\frac{B}{b}} &lt; \frac{\frac{B}{b
+ 1} - \frac{A}{a}}{\frac{A}{a}}
$$</span> We rearrange this inequality to get the multiplier that can be
used for successive applications of the test: <span
class="math display">$$
\frac{\frac{A}{a + 1} - \frac{B}{b}}{\frac{B}{b}} &lt; \frac{\frac{B}{b
+ 1} - \frac{A}{a}}{\frac{A}{a}} \Rightarrow \nonumber \\
\left( \frac{A}{a} \right) \left( \frac{A}{a + 1} - \frac{B}{b} \right)
&lt; \left( \frac{B}{b} \right) \left( \frac{B}{b + 1} - \frac{A}{a}
\right) \Rightarrow \nonumber \\
\frac{A^2}{a\left( a+1\right) } - \frac{AB}{ab} &lt; \frac{B^2}{b \left(
b+1 \right) } - \frac{AB}{ab} \Rightarrow \nonumber \\
\frac{A^2}{a \left( a + 1 \right) } &lt; \frac{B^2}{b \left( b + 1
\right) } \Rightarrow \nonumber \\
\frac{A}{\sqrt{a \left( a + 1 \right) }} &lt; \frac{B}{\sqrt{b \left( b
+ 1 \right) }}
$$</span> ## The second test for the method of equal proportions This is
similar to the first one, but instead of the ratio <span
class="math inline">$\frac{A}{a}$</span>, it uses <span
class="math inline">$\frac{a}{A}$</span>. Here, we divide the number of
representatives by the population. We can think of this as the
“individual share” each person living in the state gets of the
representative. In perfect apportionment, the equality would look like
this: <span class="math display">$$
    \frac{a}{A} = \frac{b}{B}
$$</span> Huntington defined the second test as follows(see :</p>
<p>“If the relative difference between the two”individual shares”, <span
class="math inline">$\frac{a}{A}$</span> and <span
class="math inline">$\frac{b}{B}$</span>, belonging to any two states,
can be reduced by a transfer of a representative from one state to the
other, then this transfer should be made.”</p>
<p>We can see that the equality in is the reciprocal of the one in . If
we perform transformations as seen in , we will arrive at the following
inequality (which is also the reciprocal of the one in ): <span
class="math display">$$
\frac{\sqrt{a \left( a + 1 \right) }}{A} &lt; \frac{\sqrt{b \left( b + 1
\right) }}{B}
$$</span> ## Working rule for the method of equal proportions In , we
transformed the inequality into the following: <span
class="math display">$$
\frac{A}{\sqrt{a \left( a + 1 \right) }} &lt; \frac{B}{\sqrt{b \left( b
+ 1 \right) }}
$$</span> As we are dividing the population of a state, we can interpret
it as multiplying the population of state <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> by the following fraction: <span
class="math display">$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{a \left( a + 1 \right)}}
$$</span> Let’s start by writing down the notations we will be using: -
<span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>: the number of states -
<span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span>: the number of
representatives that we need to assign - <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>: the population of state <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> - <span
class="math inline"><em>a</em></span>: the number of representatives
assigned to state <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span></p>
<p>The first thing we need to do is to write down each state, its
population and the number of representatives assigned to it. At the
start, each state will be assigned one representative. Now we see that
we need to perform the procedure <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em> − <em>r</em></span> times.</p>
<p>Every time we assign a representative, we need to multiply the
population of each state by <span class="math display">$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{a \left( a + 1 \right) }} \text{,}
$$</span> where <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> will be the
number of representatives the state currently holds (after each
iteration). The state that will be assigned the representative will be
the state with the highest population after performing the
multiplication. ## Alternative methods for apportionment</p>
<p>We can achieve alternative methods for apportionment by slightly
modifying the tests defined by Huntington for the method of the
geometric mean. By using the absolute difference instead of the relative
difference, we can arrive at the method of the harmonic mean and the
method of the arithmetic mean. These methods have been described in ,
and . ### Method of the arithmetic mean We can achieve the method of the
arithmetic mean (which we will be abbreviating as MAM) by taking the
absolute difference between the individual shares of two states.
Huntington defined the test for the method of the arithmetic mean (or
the method of major fractions) as follows (see ):</p>
<p>“If the absolute difference between the two”individual shares”, <span
class="math inline">$\frac{a}{A}$</span> and <span
class="math inline">$\frac{b}{B}$</span>, can be reduced by a transfer
of a representative from one state to the other, then this transfer
should be made (except that no state shall be left without at least one
representative).”</p>
<p>We can write the following inequality using this test (using the same
notations as before): <span class="math display">$$
\frac{a + 1}{A} - \frac{b}{B} &lt; \frac{b + 1}{B} - \frac{a}{A}
$$</span> To achieve the working rule for the method of the arithmetic
mean, we need to transform the inequality like so: <span
class="math display">$$
\frac{a + 1}{A} - \frac{b}{B} &lt; \frac{b + 1}{B} - \frac{a}{A}
\Rightarrow \\
\frac{a + 1}{A} + \frac{a}{A} &lt; \frac{b + 1}{B} + \frac{b}{B}
\Rightarrow \\
\frac{2a + 1}{A} &lt; \frac{2b + 1}{B}
$$</span> Taking the reciprocals, we get: <span class="math display">$$
\frac{A}{2a+1} &gt; \frac{B}{2b+1} \Rightarrow \nonumber \\
\frac{A}{a + \frac{1}{2}} &gt; \frac{B}{b + \frac{1}{2}}
$$</span> From this result, we can see that the multiplier for state
<span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> for the method of the
arithmetic mean will be: <span class="math display">$$
\frac{1}{a + \frac{1}{2}}
$$</span> With this multiplier, we can arrive at the working rule for
this method, which is similar to that of the method of the geometric
mean. We need to perform the same procedure as we did for the method of
equal proportions, with the only difference being the multiplier.
Instead of using , we shall use . ### Method of the harmonic mean We can
achieve the method of the harmonic mean (which we will be abbreviating
as MHM) by taking the absolute difference between the population of two
districts. Huntington defined the test for the method of the harmonic
mean as follows (see ):</p>
<p>“If the absolute difference between the two congressional districts
<span class="math inline">$\frac{A}{a}$</span> and <span
class="math inline">$\frac{B}{b}$</span>, can be reduced by a transfer
of a representative from one state to the other, then this transfer
should be made.”</p>
<p>We can write the following inequality using this test (using the same
notations as before): <span class="math display">$$
\frac{A}{a+1} - \frac{B}{b} &lt; \frac{B}{b+1} - \frac{A}{a}
$$</span> To achieve the working rule for the method of the arithmetic
mean, we need to transform the inequality like so: <span
class="math display">$$
\frac{A}{a+1} - \frac{B}{b} &lt; \frac{B}{b+1} - \frac{A}{a} \Rightarrow
\nonumber \\
\frac{A}{a+1} + \frac{A}{a} &lt; \frac{B}{b+1} + \frac{B}{b} \Rightarrow
\nonumber \\
A \left( \frac{1}{a+1} + \frac{1}{a} \right) &lt; B \left( \frac{1}{b+1}
+ \frac{1}{b} \right) \Rightarrow \nonumber \\
A \left( \frac{a}{a(a+1)} + \frac{a+1}{a(a+1)} \right) &lt; B \left(
\frac{b}{b(b+1)} + \frac{b+1}{b(b+1)} \right) \Rightarrow \nonumber \\
A \left( \frac{2a+1}{a(a+1)} \right) &lt; B \left( \frac{2b+1}{b(b+1)}
\right) \Rightarrow \nonumber \\
\frac{A}{\frac{a(a+1)}{2a+1}} &lt; \frac{B}{\frac{b(b+1)}{2b+1}}
\Rightarrow \nonumber \\
\frac{A}{2 \cdot \frac{a(a+1)}{2a+1}} &lt; \frac{B}{2 \cdot
\frac{a(a+1)}{2b+1}}
$$</span> From this result, we can see that the multiplier for state
<span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> for the method of the
harmonic mean will be: <span class="math display">$$
\frac{1}{2 \cdot \frac{a(a+1)}{2a+1}}
$$</span> With this multiplier, we can arrive at the working rule for
this method, which is similar to that of the method of the geometric
mean. We need to perform the same procedure as we did for the method of
equal proportions, with the only difference being the multiplier.
Instead of using , we shall use .</p>
