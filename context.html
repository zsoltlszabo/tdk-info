                <h2>United States</h2>
                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>After the foundation of the United States in 1776, the Founding Fathers needed to establish a method
                    for
                    choosing the officeholders in the different branches of government. </p>
                <p>The keyword when looking at the history American electoral system is "compromise". The founders
                    needed to
                    resolve the conflict between the smaller and larger states. The small states wanted each state to be
                    equally
                    represented in the decision-making, while the large states wanted representation to be proportional
                    to the
                    population. The result of this compromise was a bicameral legislature. In the Senate, every state
                    has two
                    senators, thus giving the smaller states a lot of power in the legislative process. In the House of
                    Representatives, each state has a certain number of representatives proportional to its population,
                    with
                    each state having at least one seat in the House. The US constitution requires that the seats
                    assigned to
                    each state be proportional to its population, but it doesn't specify any method to use for
                    apportionment.
                </p>
                <p>The method for electing the executive is derived from the method for electing the legislature. The
                    President
                    is not directly elected by the people, rather by the Electoral College. According to this system,
                    each state
                    is assigned a certain number of electors, who will vote according to the will of the voters. Each
                    state is
                    assigned the same number of electors as seats in the Congress (representatives + senators). Most
                    states
                    award all of their electors to the candidate who received the most votes in their state. To win the
                    election, a candidate needs the votes of a majority of all electors.</p>

                    the
                    Electoral College.</p>

                ELECTORAL MAP!
                <p>The apportionment system of the United States utilizes the Huntington method which is described in
                    detail on
                    the page about the <a href="huntington.html">Huntington method</a>.</p>

                <h2>European Union</h2>
                <h3>The history</h3>
                <p>The President of the European Commission is the most powerful official in the European Union. This
                    position
                    is comparable to prime ministers in parliamentary democracies or presidents in presidential
                    republics.</p>
                <p>The election of the President is a contentious issue after every European election. To resolve this
                    issue,
                    the Spitzenkandidaten system was developed. According to this system, the person nominated by the
                    party with
                    the most seats in the European Parliament will become the President of the European Commission. This
                    system
                    was last used in 2014, when Jean-Claude Juncker of the European People's Party was elected
                    President, after
                    the centre-right party won a plurality of seats in the European Parliament.</p>
                <p>The equivalent document of the US Constitution for the European Union which establishes the branches
                    of
                    government is the Treaty of Lisbon. It establishes the European Parliament as the primary
                    legislative
                    institution of the EU. Like the US Constitution, the Treaty does not specify the apportionment
                    method, but
                    it does set some guidelines. The document establishes the 705-seats of the European Parliament. It
                    gives
                    every member state at least six, and at most 96 seats in the Parliament.</p>
                <p>The Treaty also requires any apportionment method to adhere to the principle of degressive
                    proportionality.
                    The guidelines for the current method of apportionment were described in the Cambridge compromise,
                    which was
                    finalised at the Cambridge Apportionment Meeting (CAM). (see \cite[Page1]{Grimmett2012},
                    \cite{Grimmett2017})</p>
                <h3>The system</h3>
                ELECTORAL MAP!
                <p>Degressive proportionality means "the ratio between the population and the number of seats of each
                    Member
                    State must vary in relation to their respective populations in such a way that each Member from a
                    more
                    populous Member State represents more citizens than each Member from a less populous Member State
                    and
                    conversely, but also that no less populous Member State has more seats than a more populous Member
                    State."
                    (this is known as the Lamassoure-Severin definition, see \cite[Page 2]{Grimmett2012})</p>
                <p>The following requirements were devised at the Cambridge Apportionment Meeting:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <blockquote>"no smaller State shall receive more seats than a larger State,"</blockquote>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <blockquote>"the ratio population/seats shall increase as population increases."</blockquote>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>At the time, it seemed impossible to design a system that satisfies both requirements under the
                    hypotheticals
                    tested. This resulted in the modification of the Lamassoure-Severin definition. After the amendment,
                    it
                    defined degressive proportionality as follows:</p>
                <blockquote>"the ratio between the population and the number of seats of each Member State before
                    rounding to
                    whole numbers must vary in relation to their respective populations in such a way that each Member
                    from a
                    more populous Member State represents more citizens than each Member from a less populous Member
                    State and
                    conversely, but also that no less populous Member State has more seats than a more populous Member
                    State."
                </blockquote>
                <p>After the definition was amended, the Cambridge Apportionment Meeting developed the <em>base + prop
                        method</em> for apportionment.</p>
                <h4>Base + prop method</h4>
                <p>The base + prop method for apportionment consists of two stages, as written in \cite[Page
                    2-3]{Grimmett2012}:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The allocation of a fixed (base) number of states to each member state.</li>
                    <li>The allocation of the remaining states in proportion to the member state's population (subject
                        to
                        rounding and capping at the maximum).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To achieve the desired size for the Parliament, a house-size divisor is introduced. Using the given
                    base $b$,
                    maximum $M$ and divisor $d$, we can define the following allocation function $A_d: [0, \infty) \to
                    [0,
                    \infty)$:</p>
                $$
                A_d (p) = \min \left\{ b + \frac{p}{d}, M \right}
                $$
                <p>We shall assign the seat share $A_d (p)$ to the member state with population $p$. After that, we need
                    to
                    round this to an integer, and adjust the divisor $d$, so that the sum of the seat numbers equals the
                    desired
                    Parliament size. </p>
                <p>The Cambridge Apportionment Meeting recommended the use of base $b = 5$, and the use of upwards
                    rounding.</p>
