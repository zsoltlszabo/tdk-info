      <h2>About the paper</h2>
      <p>
        This paper is the first step in my research into electoral and
        apportionment systems. I wrote my work under the supervision of Pál
        Burai, PhD, associate professor of the Institute of Mathematics at the
        Budapest University of Technology and Economics Faculty of Natural
        Sciences.
      </p>
      <p>
        I start my paper with a brief summary of the history of the Electoral
        College. I then describe how the American apportionment system works.
        It uses a method designed by American mathematician Edward V.
        Huntington in the early 20th century, and is still in use today. It
        uses the method of the geometric mean. I also analyzed how we can
        modify this method for different mathematical means and what kind of
        effect this would have on the apportionment.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also wrote briefly about how elections for the European Parliament
        work. I adapted Huntington's method and its modified versions to the
        European elections and analyzed how it would impact the composition of
        the European Parliament, and which countries would be the biggest
        winners and losers of such a system.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the final section, I created fictional scenarios for elections
        (such as including Puerto Rico in US elections, and including Ukraine
        in European elections). To make the simulations easier, I wrote a
        Python program that would perform all of the required calculations. I
        included the code in my paper along with a line-by-line explanation of
        the code.
      </p>

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>
        The goal of this work is the analysis of the American apportionment
        system. The distribution of the number of electoral seats generated by
        different methods involving geometric, arithmetic and harmonic means
        are compared, and these methods to the European Parliament adapted.
        The data is generated by a Python program. For the examination of the
        distribution of the number of seats generated by different methods
        both real and artificial data are used.

        alt="A picture of the author presenting the work at the National Conference of Students' Research Societies" />
      <h4>Budapest University of Technology and Economics</h4>
      <p>
        My first presentation was at the students' scientific conference of
        the Budapest Technology and Economics Faculty of Natural Sciences.
        There, I competed against fellow high school students who presented
        their findings in a wide range of topics in the fields of mathematics
        and physics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The conference was held on November 17, 2022 in Building H of the
        Budapest University of Technology and Economics.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the conference, I received positive reviews of my paper and my
        presentation. The jury awarded me second place and offered me the
        opportionity to present my findings at the national conference.
      </p>
      <h4>National Conference of Students' Research Societies</h4>

      <p>
        The second presentation was held at the University of Pannonia in
        Veszprém, Hungary. This university was the host of the 36th National
        Conference of Students' Research Societies in the Physics, Earth
        Sciences and Mathematics section. I was assigned to the Operations
        research subsection. I was the only high school student competing in
        the section, where the other contestants were mainly graduate
        students. The jury gave me encouraging comments about continuing my
        research.

      <p>
        My name is Zsolt Szabó. I am currently a first-year Computer Science
        student at the Faculty of Informatics of Eötvös Lóránd University,
        Budapest.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started my research project as a high school student. I went to
        Árpád High School in my hometown of Tatabánya where I studied from
        2017 to 2023. I completed my high school leaving exam there as well,
        where I received an award for achieving the highest scores of the
        school.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my high school years, I participated in many competitions in my
        fields of interest. I competed on the national level a few times, most
        notably achieving 15th? place at the National Competition for High
        School Students in Computer Science, which is the most prestigious
        high school competition in Hungary.
      </p>
      <p>
        My main academic interests are Computer Science and Mathematics, but I
        am interested in many other topics such as politics, modern history
        and international relations as well, which is one of the reasons why I
        chose this research topic. I am glad that I have the opportunity to
        research a subject where I can use both my mathematical and my
        political interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2023, I was awarded the title of the most successful high school
        student by the Mayor of Tatabánya.

      <h2>The future of the research</h2>
      <p>
        This website is about the paper that I originally presented at the
        National Conference of Students' Research Societies, however I wish to
        continue my research beyond my findings in this paper. Currently, I
        have two main directions that I would like to continue my research in.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first is a deeper analysis of why some methods benefit smaller
        states while others benefit larger states. I wish to find an exact
        mathematical formula that we can use to exactly define what a 'small'
        and a 'large' state is.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second is looking at how we can include more factors in
        apportionment. In the apportionment methods that I discussed in my
        paper, the sole factor that determines how many representatives a
        state has is its population. Using the Bajraktarevic mean, I would
        like to explore how we can add further factors (such as
        <abbr title="Gross Domestic Product">GDP</abbr>,
        <abbr title="Human Development Index">HDI</abbr>) that determine the
        number of representatives a state has. I believe that this topic is
        especially relevent in Europe, where the enlargement of the Union
        poses new political questions regarding apportionment, and the
        inclusion of other factors when assigning the seats to each country
        may help solve these issues.
